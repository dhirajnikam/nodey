🚀 **introducing nodey: text-to-flowchart ai for your terminal** 🚀

i’m excited to announce the v1.0 release of **nodey** – a tool i designed to solve a problem we all face: **documentation friction.**

we all know we *should* make flowcharts for our systems, but dragging boxes around in UI tools takes forever.

💡 **what is nodey?**
Nodey is a terminal-based agentic ai architect. you describe your logic in plain english, and it:
1.  **analyzes** your requirements for ambiguity.
2.  **architects** a logical flow structure.
3.  **validates** it with a judge agent.
4.  **generates** a premium, interactive HTML artifact instantly.

✨ **key features:**
*   **multi-agent core**: 4 specialized AI agents work in unison.
*   **premium ui**: generates dagre.js auto-layout charts with glassmorphism inspection panels.
*   **terminal native**: built in Go with Bubble Tea for a pure keyboard workflow.

it’s open source and written in **Go**. i’d love for you to try it out and let me know what you think!

👇 **get it now:**
